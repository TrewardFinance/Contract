## What is Treward
The Treward project is an Experimental project built with the Frictionless Yield Generation on the BSC network.

## How is it working
Treward token charges a 2.5% fee for each transaction and distributes 1.5% of this fee to holders and burns the remaining 1%

## How much are the rewards
The Treward project is creating a reward pool for 2000 tokens to early investors. This pool will automatically distribute 2% of every buy transaction made token holders.

## Staking and farming
Farming and staking will be started on the date specified on the road map and the details will be announced at that time

## How to Staking and Farming?
With Farming and Staking features, we aim for maximum return from the Frictionless Yield Generation model. Investors staking RWD will earn our farming token with limited supply. It will also continue to earn a 1.5% fee for each transaction.

## Change fee rate
The fee rate, which is 1.5%, can be changed if a joint decision is taken by the community

## Change the burn rate
The burn rate of 1% can be changed if a collective decision is taken by the community

## Change the reward rate
The reward pool will be used to encourage trade. For this reason, the reward rate of 2% can be changed by the community
